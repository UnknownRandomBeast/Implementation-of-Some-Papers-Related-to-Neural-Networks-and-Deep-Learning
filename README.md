# Implementation-of-Some-Papers-Related-to-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning

This repository contains Python implementations of various papers that I have studied during my Neural Networks and Deep Learning course. These implementations were part of the course homework assignments. I plan to implement more papers related to this field in the future. Therefore, I will be updating this repository periodically so that you can access all my paper implementations. The papers and models Iâ€™ve implemented so far include:

1. Mcculloch-Pitts, Adaline, Madaline, multi-layer perceptron, transfer learning, and clustering using a deep autoencoder, based on [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07472) paper

2. Preprocessing, data augmentation, and solving the Face emotion recognition problem using CNN, AlexNet, VGGNet, and MobileNet, based on [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08775) paper

3. Faster RCNN for object detection, based on [this](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1827/1/012085/pdf) paper

4. LSTM, GRU, Bi-Directional LSTM, MLP, CNN, Conv-LSTM, and Naive forecast for time series prediction, based on [this](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10186554) paper

5. Persian speech emotion recognition using HuBERT, based on [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07447) paper

6. Sentiment analysis of Persian tweets
using CNN-LSTM model and implementation of required preprocessing steps as well as feature representation based on [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07740) paper


**Note:**  You may find identical code to sections 3 to 5 [here](https://github.com/Ipouyall/DeepNeuralNetworkExploration). This is because the course homework assignments could be completed in pairs, and the individual I mentioned was my partner for those assignments. Each of us implemented a completely different paper. However, our collaboration has since ended, and as a result, I have not included his code here. Despite this, he has uploaded my code on his own GitHub page without crediting me!
